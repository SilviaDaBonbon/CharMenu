These are not yet done, just getting this area ready for when I add instructions

# Instructions

Firstly, ensure that you have the main assets installed, which are just the images. Go follow the instructions in the [Main Assets Needed Folder](../../Main%20Assets%20Needed/)

Then, you will go to the folder with the same name as the engine you need to add the Character Menu to.
(e.g. You need the CharMenu for Kade, then you will go to the [Kade Folder](./Kade/) or if you need it for Psych, then you will go to the [Psych Folder](./Psych/))
